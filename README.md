# Hardhat Project Template

This is my personal preferred setup for hardhat projects using typescript.  

### Features:

- Typescript with Typechain
- Test utilities
- Set up for Polygon

### Setup

1. Copy .env.example to .env and modify it to your needs.
2. `yarn upgrade` to install packages
3. `yarn test` to run tests
4. Specify a block to run tests on in hardhat.config.ts. Needs to be defined twice.
